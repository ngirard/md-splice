# Progress Status

- update 01: Finished Strategy Phase 1 Step 1.1 by introducing the `apply` CLI subcommand (`ApplyArgs`) and an integration test (`tests/apply.rs`) that now verifies an operations source is required. Command executed: `cargo test apply_subcommand_requires_operations_source` (passes).
- update 02: Finished Strategy Phase 1 Step 1.2 by adding `src/transaction.rs` with serde-backed data structures and a unit test that deserializes the sample operations list. Command executed: `cargo test deserialize_operations_example` (passes).
- update 03: Finished Strategy Phase 2 Step 2.1 by introducing the `process_apply` runner (replace-only) with supporting helpers and a unit test `process_apply_replaces_matching_block`. Command executed: `cargo test process_apply_replaces_matching_block` (passes).
- update 04: Finished Strategy Phase 2 Step 2.2 by wiring `process_apply` into the CLI flow, parsing operations via `serde_yaml`, and adding the integration test `apply_command_applies_replace_operation`. Command executed: `cargo test apply_command_applies_replace_operation` (passes).
- update 05: Finished Strategy Phase 3 Step 3.1 by adding transactional insert support, including the new unit test `process_apply_inserts_list_item_before_target`. Command executed: `cargo test process_apply -- --nocapture` (passes).
- update 06: Finished Strategy Phase 3 Step 3.2 by adding transactional delete support (including section deletes) and the unit test `process_apply_deletes_list_item_and_section`. Command executed: `cargo test process_apply -- --nocapture` (passes).
- update 07: Finished Strategy Phase 4 by making `process_apply` atomic (cloning the document before applying operations) and adding safeguards via the unit test `process_apply_is_atomic_when_operation_fails` and integration test `apply_command_is_atomic_when_operation_fails`. Commands executed: `cargo test process_apply_is_atomic_when_operation_fails`, `cargo test --test apply apply_command_is_atomic_when_operation_fails`, and `cargo test` (all pass).

- update 08: Finished Strategy Phase 5 (Steps 5.1 and 5.2) by adding full support for
  `--dry-run` and `--diff`, including stdout rendering, unified diff generation, and
  new integration tests (`apply_command_supports_dry_run`,
  `apply_command_supports_diff_output`) with snapshot coverage. Commands executed:
  `cargo test apply_command_supports_ -- --nocapture`, `cargo test` (both pass).

- update 09: Finished Strategy Phase 6 (Steps 6.1–6.3) by documenting the `apply` workflow.
  Updated `README.md` with transaction usage guidance, operations file structure, examples,
  and command reference entries, and refreshed `Transactions-specification.md` with clarified
  CLI behaviors. (Documentation change; no tests run.)

Remaining: None — documentation phase complete and multi-operation support fully delivered.
