# Progress Status

- update 01: Finished Strategy Phase 1 Step 1.1 by introducing the `apply` CLI subcommand (`ApplyArgs`) and an integration test (`tests/apply.rs`) that now verifies an operations source is required. Command executed: `cargo test apply_subcommand_requires_operations_source` (passes).
- update 02: Finished Strategy Phase 1 Step 1.2 by adding `src/transaction.rs` with serde-backed data structures and a unit test that deserializes the sample operations list. Command executed: `cargo test deserialize_operations_example` (passes).
- update 03: Finished Strategy Phase 2 Step 2.1 by introducing the `process_apply` runner (replace-only) with supporting helpers and a unit test `process_apply_replaces_matching_block`. Command executed: `cargo test process_apply_replaces_matching_block` (passes).
- update 04: Finished Strategy Phase 2 Step 2.2 by wiring `process_apply` into the CLI flow, parsing operations via `serde_yaml`, and adding the integration test `apply_command_applies_replace_operation`. Command executed: `cargo test apply_command_applies_replace_operation` (passes).
- update 05: Finished Strategy Phase 3 Step 3.1 by adding transactional insert support, including the new unit test `process_apply_inserts_list_item_before_target`. Command executed: `cargo test process_apply -- --nocapture` (passes).
- update 06: Finished Strategy Phase 3 Step 3.2 by adding transactional delete support (including section deletes) and the unit test `process_apply_deletes_list_item_and_section`. Command executed: `cargo test process_apply -- --nocapture` (passes).

Remaining work: implement transactional safeguards (Phase 4) and UX enhancements for `--dry-run`/`--diff` (Phase 5).
