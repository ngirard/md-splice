# Progress Status

- update 01: Finished Strategy Phase 1 Step 1.1 by introducing the `apply` CLI subcommand (`ApplyArgs`) and an integration test (`tests/apply.rs`) that now verifies an operations source is required. Command executed: `cargo test apply_subcommand_requires_operations_source` (passes).
- update 02: Finished Strategy Phase 1 Step 1.2 by adding `src/transaction.rs` with serde-backed data structures and a unit test that deserializes the sample operations list. Command executed: `cargo test deserialize_operations_example` (passes).

The multi-operation feature is not complete yet; upcoming work includes implementing the transaction runner and wiring it into the CLI flow.
