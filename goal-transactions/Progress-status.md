# Progress Status

- update 01: Finished Strategy Phase 1 Step 1.1 by introducing the `apply` CLI subcommand (`ApplyArgs`) and an integration test (`tests/apply.rs`) that now verifies an operations source is required. Command executed: `cargo test apply_subcommand_requires_operations_source` (passes).
- update 02: Finished Strategy Phase 1 Step 1.2 by adding `src/transaction.rs` with serde-backed data structures and a unit test that deserializes the sample operations list. Command executed: `cargo test deserialize_operations_example` (passes).
- update 03: Finished Strategy Phase 2 Step 2.1 by introducing the `process_apply` runner (replace-only) with supporting helpers and a unit test `process_apply_replaces_matching_block`. Command executed: `cargo test process_apply_replaces_matching_block` (passes).
- update 04: Finished Strategy Phase 2 Step 2.2 by wiring `process_apply` into the CLI flow, parsing operations via `serde_yaml`, and adding the integration test `apply_command_applies_replace_operation`. Command executed: `cargo test apply_command_applies_replace_operation` (passes).

The multi-operation feature is not complete yet; upcoming work includes extending `process_apply` to support insert/delete operations and implementing the `--dry-run` and `--diff` flags.
