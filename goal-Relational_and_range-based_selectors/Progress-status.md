update 01: Reviewed Specification.md and Strategy.md. Started Phase 1 by planning scoped locator tests and data structure changes.
update 02: Implemented Phase 1 scoped selection logic in locator.rs, including new after/within fields, scope resolution helpers, and comprehensive unit tests. All tests pass via `cargo test`.
update 03: Completed Phase 2 CLI integration by introducing new `--after-*`, `--within-*`, and `--until-*` flags with end-to-end tests (`tests/scoped_selectors.rs`) and updated help snapshots. Implemented scoped and range logic in process handlers and ensured `cargo test` passes.
update 04: Finished Phase 3 by extending transactions to support nested scoped selectors and range-based 'until' spans, added corresponding unit/integration tests, and completed Phase 4 documentation updates. All checks pass with 'cargo test'. Task fully accomplished.
