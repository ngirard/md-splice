# Progress Status

## update 01
- Implemented Phase 1 (Foundational - Parsing & Data Structures).
- Added frontmatter parsing module with YAML/TOML detection, conversion, and fixtures-based unit tests.
- Integrated parser into CLI flow to preserve existing frontmatter when rendering output.
- Next: begin Phase 2 by adding CLI surface for `frontmatter get` once foundational parsing stabilizes.
## update 02
- Delivered Phase 2 (Read-Only Operations) by introducing the `md-splice frontmatter get` command with support for dot/array key paths and configurable output formats (string/json/yaml).
- Added CLI wiring, parsing helpers, and stdout rendering utilities to expose parsed frontmatter without altering the Markdown body flow.
- Implemented comprehensive integration coverage for frontmatter reads and refreshed CLI help snapshot to surface the new subcommand.
- Next: move into Phase 3 by building `frontmatter set`/`delete`, including mutation helpers and serialization back to disk.

## update 03
- Completed Phase 3 (Write Operations) by adding `frontmatter set` and `frontmatter delete` subcommands with YAML/TOML-aware serialization.
- Implemented mutation helpers for nested maps/arrays, YAML value parsing from inline strings or files, and automatic removal of empty frontmatter blocks.
- Extended integration suite to cover creation, updates, format selection, and deletion flows for frontmatter mutations.
- Next: integrate frontmatter mutations into transactional `apply` operations (Phase 4).

## update 04
- Delivered Phase 4 (Transactional Integration) by extending `apply` operations with `set_frontmatter`, `delete_frontmatter`, and `replace_frontmatter` support, keeping frontmatter changes atomic alongside body edits.
- Added reusable helpers for setting, deleting, and replacing frontmatter so both the CLI and transaction engine share validation/serialization logic.
- Expanded `apply` integration tests to cover mixed frontmatter/body changes, error rollback guarantees, and format switching for replacement operations.
- Next: move to Phase 5 to update documentation, CLI help text, and run final polish passes before release.

## update 05
- Completed Phase 5 (Documentation & Finalization) by adding comprehensive README coverage for direct frontmatter commands, transactional operations, and CLI reference details.
- Updated user guidance to reflect YAML/TOML preservation, key notation, value sourcing, and atomic failure behavior for metadata workflows.
- Confirmed command listings now surface the `frontmatter` namespace so end-users can discover and learn the new capabilities in one place.
- Status: Frontmatter support is fully delivered and ready for release.
