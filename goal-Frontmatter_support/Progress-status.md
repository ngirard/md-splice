# Progress Status

## update 01
- Implemented Phase 1 (Foundational - Parsing & Data Structures).
- Added frontmatter parsing module with YAML/TOML detection, conversion, and fixtures-based unit tests.
- Integrated parser into CLI flow to preserve existing frontmatter when rendering output.
- Next: begin Phase 2 by adding CLI surface for `frontmatter get` once foundational parsing stabilizes.
