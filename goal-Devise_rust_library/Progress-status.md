update 01: Completed Step 1 workspace restructuring. Established a Cargo workspace with `md-splice-lib` (library) and `md-splice` (binary) members, migrated source files accordingly, relocated integration tests under the binary crate, updated fixture paths, and verified the build with `cargo build --workspace` and `cargo test --workspace`.
update 02: Delivered Step 2 library API foundation. Added the new `MarkdownDocument` type with `from_str`, `apply`, and `render` methods, refactored internal helpers to reuse transactional operations, introduced `SpliceError` variants for parse/IO failures, and created `md-splice-lib/tests/api.rs` to exercise document loading, rendering, body replacement, and frontmatter mutation through the public API. All workspace tests succeed via `cargo test --workspace`.
