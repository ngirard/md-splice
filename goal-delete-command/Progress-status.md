update 01:
- Added initial integration test covering `delete --help` output per Phase 1 Step 1.1.
- Implemented CLI scaffolding with `delete`/`remove` subcommand and `DeleteArgs`, returning early in `run()` as per Phase 1 Step 1.2.
- Test `delete_help_lists_expected_flags` now passes, confirming parser wiring.

update 02:
- Followed Phase 2 Step 2.1 by adding `delete_paragraph_by_content` integration test verifying paragraph removal via selectors.
- Implemented core deletion pipeline: refactored `run()` command dispatch, added helpers, wired new `process_delete`, and introduced `splicer::delete` per Step 2.2 (list item & section deletion intentionally pending).
- New test passes alongside existing help test, confirming basic block deletion behavior.

update 03:
- Added list item deletion snapshot tests (`delete_list_item`, `delete_last_list_item_removes_list`) per Phase 3 Step 3.1.
- Implemented `splicer::delete_list_item` plus parent block cleanup and integrated logic into `process_delete`, completing Phase 3 Step 3.2.
- Both new tests now pass individually, verifying list item removal and empty-list cleanup.

update 04:
- Added section-deletion tests (`delete_heading_with_section_flag`, `delete_with_section_flag_on_non_heading_fails`) per Phase 4 Step 4.1.
- Implemented `SpliceError::InvalidSectionDelete`, new `splicer::delete_section`, and expanded `process_delete` validation to satisfy Phase 4 Step 4.2.
- Snapshot and failure-mode tests now pass, confirming heading-section removal and error handling.

update 05:
- Completed Phase 5 documentation by expanding README with delete command coverage, usage, and examples.
- Ran `cargo fmt`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, and `cargo test --all-features` to finalize implementation.
- All checks pass; delete command feature set is fully implemented.
