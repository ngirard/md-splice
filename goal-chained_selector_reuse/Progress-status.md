# Progress Log

## Latest update
- **update 02:** Milestones 1–4 completed; selector alias resolution wired through Rust core, Python bindings, CLI, and tests.

## Active Workstreams
- Milestone 5 — author targeted alias-focused test coverage (Rust + Python) beyond adjusted regressions.
- Milestone 6 — documentation updates for selector alias workflows (README + Python README).

## Archive Reference

Detailed historical updates live in
`Progress-archive.md`. Consult the archive for
granular changelogs before drafting new summaries here.

## Archival Process

1. Record full narrative updates, checklists, and evidence in
   `Progress-archive.md` whenever significant work completes.
2. Distill the corresponding phase impacts into this dashboard, updating the
   "Phase Status" bullets without duplicating archival prose.
3. Revise "Next steps" to surface actionable follow-ups, then note the archival
   action taken so future agents can trace decisions.

## Next steps
- Craft alias-specific happy-path and failure-path tests covering `selector_ref`, `within_ref`, `after_ref`, and duplicate alias errors.
- Update user documentation (root README and Python README) with selector reuse examples and guidance.
