## Archival Process

1. Record full narrative updates, checklists, and evidence in
   `Progress-archive.md` whenever significant work completes.
2. Distill the corresponding phase impacts into this dashboard, updating the
   "Phase Status" bullets without duplicating archival prose.
3. Revise "Next steps" to surface actionable follow-ups, then note the archival
   action taken so future agents can trace decisions.

## Next steps
- No follow-up required; treat the goal as complete unless new requirements emerge.
